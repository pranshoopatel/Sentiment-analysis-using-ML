OVERVIEW and USE
Sentiment analysis, otherwise known as opinion mining, is a critical field in the area of natural language processing (NLP) and text mining[1]. It is the identification, extraction, and analysis of opinions, sentiments, and emotional tones within text. The analysis provides information on whether the sentiment in the text is negative, positive, or neutral, hence making it a very important tool for determining consumer opinion, tracking public sentiment, and hence informing business strategies.
The growth in online platforms such as social media, e-commerce websites, forums, and blogs of unstructured text data has been so immense that one can only imagine such growth. Sites such as Amazon have millions of product reviews, where the customers give their free expression of thought. With such enormous data, it is impossible to analyze manually. This is exactly where sentiment analysis comes in, which would use algorithms and models to extract and classify sentiments automatically.
